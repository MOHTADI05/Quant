Market Simulator
This project is a Market Simulator designed to help investors and financial analysts make informed decisions based on quantitative calculations, actuarial science, and risk analysis. It integrates various financial models and techniques to provide comprehensive market analysis and portfolio optimization.

Features
Quantitative Calculations:

Analyze and forecast market trends using statistical and mathematical methods.
Actuarial Science for Risk Management:

Calculate risk associated with portfolios, considering factors like volatility and market conditions.
Portfolio Optimization:

Maximize portfolio performance by optimizing asset allocation using modern portfolio theory (MPT).
Monte Carlo Simulations:

Generate multiple possible outcomes for market performance to better understand and anticipate risks and rewards.
Options Pricing using Black-Scholes:

Accurately price European options based on variables like stock price, strike price, volatility, time to expiration, and risk-free rate.
Installation
To get started with the Market Simulator, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-simulator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd market-simulator
Install dependencies (if applicable):

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

python main.py
Usage
Portfolio Optimization:
Define your asset pool, expected returns, and risk tolerance.
Run the optimization algorithm to get the best asset allocation based on the risk-return profile.
Risk Analysis:
Input the necessary data (volatility, market conditions, etc.) to calculate the risk of your portfolio using actuarial methods.
Monte Carlo Simulation:
Simulate thousands of possible future states of the market to assess potential risks and returns under various conditions.
Options Pricing:
Use the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of European-style options based on the input parameters.
Models & Algorithms
Monte Carlo Simulation: Utilized to predict future stock prices and market trends by generating multiple scenarios.
Black-Scholes Model: Used for options pricing, providing a closed-form solution for pricing European options.
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT): A framework for constructing an optimal portfolio, balancing risk and return.
Dependencies
